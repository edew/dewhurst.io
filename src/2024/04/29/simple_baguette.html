        <p>This is the baguette recipe that I have been following for the past few months.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>475g strong white flour</li>
          <li>375ml water</li>
          <li>8g salt</li>
          <li>1g yeast</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Add the dry ingredients to a bowl followed by the water. Mix until the dough just starts to come together. Ideally it shouldn't be sticking to the sides too much.</p>

        <p>Cover and leave the dough for 4 hours or preferably overnight.</p>

        <p>Heat your oven to 220 Â°C. Shape the dough in to two equally sized baguettes and bake until golden brown. Leave to cool slightly before eating.</p>
