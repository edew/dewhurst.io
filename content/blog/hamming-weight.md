Suppose we have the number 45<sub>10</sub>, or 00101101<sub>2</sub>.

How can we calculate the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of the number?

## Hamming weight

Luckily this is a well defined corner of computer science, in fact Peter Wegner described a algorithm for doing just this 60 years ago!
